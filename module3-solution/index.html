              <p id="chicken-method">Marinate the chicken: Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe. Cook the chicken: Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan. Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan. Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later. Start making the sauce: Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency. Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Puree the sauce with the nuts: Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste. Finish the dish: Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce. As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes. Rest the butter chicken: Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken. Serve: Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for five days. You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture. Slice the chicken into bite-sized chunks. Combine the cubed chicken with the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, salt, cumin, garam masala, and paprika and stir until well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Line a high-sided baking pan or roasting tray with parchment paper. Place the marinated chicken pieces on bamboo or wooden skewers, then set them over the prepared baking pan, making sure there is space underneath the chicken to help distribute the heat more evenly. Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly dark brown on the edges. Make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, then sauté the onions, ginger, and garlic until tender but not browned. Add the cumin, turmeric, coriander, paprika, chili powder, and garam masala and stir constantly for about 30 seconds, until the spices are fragrant. Stir in the tomato puree, tomato sauce, and 1 ¼ cups of water, then bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. Pour in the cream. Remove the chicken from the skewers and add to the sauce, cooking for another 1-2 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice or alongside naan bread. Enjoy!</p>

              <div class="text-center" id="beef-title"> Beef </div>
              <p id="beef-method">Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Rub the meat with 1 tsp of the oil and plenty of seasoning. Heat a large flameproof casserole dish and brown the meat all over for about 10 mins. Meanwhile, add 2 tsp oil to a frying pan and fry the carrots and celery for 10 mins until turning golden. Lift the beef onto a plate, splash the wine into the hot casserole and boil for 2 mins. Pour in the stock, return the beef, then tuck in the carrots, celery and bay leaves, trying not to submerge the carrots too much. Cover and cook in the oven for 2 hrs. (I like to turn the beef halfway through cooking.) Meanwhile, thinly slice the onions. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan and stir in the onions, thyme and some seasoning. Cover and cook gently for 20 mins until the onions are softened but not coloured. Remove the lid, turn up the heat, add the butter and sugar, then let the onions caramelise to a dark golden brown, stirring often. Remove the thyme sprigs, then set aside. When the beef is ready, it will be tender and easy to pull apart at the edges. Remove it from the casserole and snip off the strings. Reheat the onion pan, stir in the flour and cook for 1 min. Whisk the floury onions into the beefy juices in the casserole, to make a thick onion gravy. Taste for seasoning. Add the beef and carrots back to the casserole, or slice the beef and bring to the table on a platter, with the carrots to the side and the gravy spooned over. Let the meat come to room temperature for 1 hr before you roast it. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Dry the meat with kitchen paper, then rub the oil all over it. Mix the mustard powder with the sea salt and 1 tsp pepper, then rub this over the meat too. Lay the carrots in a large roasting tin to make a trivet and sit the beef on top, fat-side up. Roast for 15 mins, then turn the heat down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and roast for another 55 mins. This will give you medium beef; for medium-rare, cook for 45 mins. (When it’s done, a probe thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the beef should read 65C). With 30 mins cooking time left, baste the beef in the fat that has pooled in the tin, add the shallots and bay leaves, and coat these in the fat too. Season and return to the oven. Meanwhile, boil the wine in a small saucepan to reduce it by two-thirds. When the meat is ready, transfer to a board, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest. Turn the oven up to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and return the tin to the oven for a further 10-15 mins until the shallots are tender. Scoop out the shallots with a slotted spoon and set aside to keep warm. Remove the excess fat from the tin and discard, leaving 1 tbsp fat and all the dark juices behind. Add the flour and cook on the hob for 2 mins, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the reduced wine, followed by the stock and redcurrant jelly, scraping up all the tasty bits from the bottom of the tin. Bubble until thickened and rich, add the juices from the resting meat, then season to taste. Discard the carrots. Serve the beef with the gravy and shallots.</p>

              <div class="text-center" id="sushi-title"> Sushi </div>
              <p id="sushi-method"> Nori is a type of seaweed, and you can get sheets of roasted nori in most Asian markets and specialty food shops, such as Whole Foods. And while the professionals can easily roll sushi with full size sheets or nori, I suggest that beginners cut the sheets in half and work with that size. Having a smaller sheet of nori gives you more control over the sushi roll. Nori absorbs moisture pretty easily. So unless you use all 10 sheets of the nori in one sitting, you want to save it for later. For best results, seal in a ziplock bag, but also put in a teaspoon of uncooked rice to absorb any moisture. Then, the next time you go for nori, it'll still be nice and crisp! Y you can buy pre-made sticky rice, and simply add 2 tablespoons of seasoned rice vinegar for every cup of rice. Make sure to buy seasoned rice vinegar. Regular rice vinegar doesn't contain the sugar that you need for sushi rice to have a slightly sweet flavor. If you accidentally get regular rice vinegar, just add 1 tablespoon of sugar to every half cup of vinegar. For the extremely lazy, you can just buy sushi rice from certain locations like Japanese markets and Whole Foods for a few bucks. But you didn't hear that from me. When it comes to deciding on the fillings for your sushi, the sky's the limit. Common ingredients include raw fish (pictured here are salmon and tuna), crab, tempura, mango (also pictured here), avocado, cucumber, carrots, and the list goes on. Whatever your heart desires—go for it. Just make sure that you cut into small strips. When you buy fish for your sushi rolls, the fresher the better. To test the freshness, push down with your index finger on the fish meat. If it's fresh, it should spring back. If it's not as fresh, there will be an indentation. The fish is still perfectly edible if there is an indentation, it just means that it's not quite as fresh as it could be. Lay out the nori on the bamboo mat (or whatever you're using). Feel the nori; there should be a rough side and a smooth side. Make sure that the rough side is facing up. Use your fingers to carefully spread the rice out over the nori. You want the rice to be spread out so that it looks nice and lacy, with some nori showing through the rice. (The adjective "lacy" means being lace-like, as in you can see through it.) It can get quite sticky, so make sure that you have a small bowl of water nearby so that you can wash your fingers off whenever they get too covered with rice! Make sure not go over the bottom quarter! Otherwise, it will be hard to roll. Next, carefully roll the sushi so that the end piece of the nori, rice, and ingredients curve over so that you have a shape that looks almost like a snail. Give the roll a gentle squeeze to compress the ingredients. Roll the rest of the roll up into a little Japanese burrito, using your fingers. Use the bamboo mat to compress the roll again, squeezing gently. Remove the mat and place the roll on a cutting board. Using a very sharp knife, cut it into rounds. Make sure to clean the blade of the knife after every time you cut off a piece of sushi. The blade will quickly become sticky, so if you don't clean it, the sushi will be very difficult to cut. Arrange on a plate and ta-da... beautiful sushi. </p>
