                <p> This dummy text is not plagiarised. It is part of a college report. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the major reasons of deaths worldwide, which accounts for approximately 17.9 million lives lost annually. Cardiovascular diseases are heart and blood vessels affecting disorders which include rheumatic heart disease, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and other such conditions. Nearly 85% of all the CVD deaths occur because of strokes and heart attacks. One of the major global causes of death is Myocardial Infarction (MI), which is popularly known as heart attack. A heart attack is said to have occurred when a coronary artery of the heart gets blocked suddenly or the blood flow in it becomes extremely slow. Muscles of specific parts of the heart’s wall receive blood from different coronary arteries. Blockage in the coronary artery does not allow the blood to reach the heart muscle and hence that muscle dies. Therefore, the death of a heart muscle or any of its part can be termed as a heart attack. Rupturing of a plaque, formation of a blood clot or both are mostly responsible for clogging the coronary artery. Generally clotting occurs in a coronary artery which has been attenuated by atherosclerosis. The condition of build-up of deposition of fatty substances along the inner blood vessel walls is called atherosclerosis. </p>
